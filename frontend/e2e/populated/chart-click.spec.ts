// Regression coverage for a real click-through bug: TokensPerDayChart's
// visible segments render `height: Math.max(height, 0)` - a zero-token
// day's segments are all 0-height, which Playwright (correctly) refuses to
// click as "not visible." The fix added `ColumnHitArea`, a full-plot-height
// invisible rect (Recharts' `background` prop on the baseline `<Bar>`,
// sized off the plot area rather than that day's own value) carrying the
// `chart-bar-${date}` testid instead. fixtures/seed.py clusters all its
// session data within the last 2 days of "now" - the 30-day Trend window's
// oldest (leftmost) bar is reliably a zero-token day, so clicking it is
// exactly the case a visible-bar-only hit target would fail on.
